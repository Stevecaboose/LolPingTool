League of Legends Ping Tool NA by Stevecabbage/Stevecaboose

This is a simple tool that uses commands in Windows Command Prompt to
quickly get the min, max and average of the users ping over the interval
of 4 seconds. Each packet is 32 bytes and is sent each second. You do not
need to close the program and reopen it to check your ping again. This is
a great tool that can be easily mapped to a key on your keyboard to quickly
check your ping before you commit to a ranked game. At this time, it only checks
the North American server. If this program hits off, I may add options for other
servers. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism please send me a message.
Thanks and enjoy :)
